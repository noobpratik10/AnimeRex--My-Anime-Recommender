What is left of mankind now lives within the Monolith walls, walls that are made of Varanium, the only material that can hurt Gastrea.\\n\\nTo counter the threat that the Gastrea pose, \"Cursed Children\"âfemale children whose bodies contain trace amounts of the virus which grant them superhuman abilitiesâofficially called Initiators by the Tendo Civil Security, are given partners called Promoters, people who work to guide and protect the young Initiators. These teams of two are sent out on missions to fight the monsters created by the Gastrea virus and keep them at bay. \\n\\nBlack Bullet revolves around the team of Enju Aihara, an Initiator, and Satomi Rentaro, a Promoter, as they go on missions to fight the growing threat of Gastrea in their hometown of Tokyo.   \n","8315                                                                                                                                                                                       For centuries, humanity has been hunted by giant, mysterious predators known as the Titans. Three mighty wallsâWall Maria, Rose, and Sheenaâprovided peace and protection for humanity for over a hundred years. That peace, however, was shattered when the Colossal Titan and Armored Titan appeared and destroyed the outermost wall, Wall Maria. Forced to retreat behind Wall Rose, humanity waited with bated breath for the Titans to reappear and destroy their safe haven once more.\\n\\nIn Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2, Eren Yeager and others of the 104th Training Corps have just begun to become full members of the Survey Corps. As they ready themselves to face the Titans once again, their preparations are interrupted by the invasion of Wall Roseâbut all is not as it seems as more mysteries are unraveled.

On the brink of extinction, humans prayed to their gods, calling out for someone to save them. Emerging from these desperate pleas for salvation, battle deities known as the \"Idaten\" were born. Possessing unnatural strength and endurance, the Idaten managed to defeat the demons and an era of unprecedented peace was finally ushered in.\\n\\nHaving never encountered demons before, the present generation of Idaten knows nothing of the demon's brutality, but they have instead only lived a  peaceful existence.
